# Introduction

This game follows Alice, an overworked employee who inherits what she believes is a mansion in the suburbs, only to discover it’s a dilapidated house on a small piece of land. Despite the setback, Alice decides to leave her stressful city life behind and use her skills to rebuild the property from scratch. The game focuses on her journey of transformation as she renovates the house, adapts to rural life, and forms new friendships, blending elements of simulation, resource management, and personal growth.
