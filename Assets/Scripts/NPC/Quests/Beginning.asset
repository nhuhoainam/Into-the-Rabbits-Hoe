  startDialog:
  - Hello, I'm Koewyner, the mayor of this town on the island. You must be Rachmin's
    nephew.
  - Haha, I've heard Rachmin talk about you all the time. Finally, I get to meet
    you.
  - You probably have many questions. I'll explain many things on Rachmin's behalf.
  - Back in the day, Rachmin, Oskkea, and I were three close friends.
  - Rachmin used to be very lazy, only living off his parents.
  - Every time I went to his house, I would hear them scolding him.
  - I advised him to go out and work, but he didn't listen.
  - Then one day, his father had an accident and needed urgent surgery.
  - "However, the family\u2019s savings were mostly spent on Rachmin\u2019s extravagant
    lifestyle, so it was almost impossible to gather enough money for the surgery."
  - Without enough money for the surgery, his father passed away that night.
  - Rachmin was very sad and regretful.
  - After that, he decided to work hard to earn a lot of money to take care of his
    family.
  - He left everything behind and went looking for a job.
  - He left everything behind and went looking for a job.
  - I heard that due to his exceptional talent, he became very rich.
  - Later on, he bought two islands.
  - This island is one of them. He let the villagers live here and provided amenities
    to improve their lives.
  - The other island is where Rachmin, Oskkea, and I used to live together. Like
    retirement, haha.
  - Unfortunately, due to many illnesses caused by overwork in his youth, Rachmin
    also passed away.
  - I was sad and moved to the other island to live and became the mayor.
  - Oskkea moved to the seaside. You can visit him whenever you have time.
  - The other island is what Rachmin left for you. so try to develop it.
  - Whenever you have problems, you can come to me.
  - 'Let me give you some seeds. When you have planted all of them, come back to
    see me. '
  - 'Let me give you some seeds. When you have planted all of them, come back to
    see me. '
  - "Oh, and I\u2019ll also have someone clear the trees on the right side of Starting
    Town so you have space to plant."
  inProgressDialog:
  - "It seems you\u2019re not used to it in the first few days. Try harder. I have
    some work to do now, I\u2019ll come back tomorrow."
  endDialog:
  - Wow, you did a great job.
  - ' I will support you with some startup capital.'
  - "Whenever you need anything, come back to see me. I\u2019m always willing to
    support you."
  newDefaultDialog:
  - You are indeed a hardworking person, keep it up!
